In order to adapt to the times, the current OSCA officers, staff, and some members of the OSCA alumni community put our minds together to build a new website from the ground up.\n\nThe new website is <em>currently under construction</em>, but we encourage you to check back early February for more information.\n\nWe also plan to run the lottery entirely from this website. More details will be available closer to February 1, 2021."
