  "body": "**With a new year and a new rent contract**, OSCA has had to make some major changes. In order to adapt to the times, the current OSCA officers, staff, and some members of the OSCA alumni community put our minds together to build a new website from the ground up. \n\nThe new website is _currently in beta_, but we're happy to announce that the lottery is up and running! If you experience issues with the lottery, reach out to osca.coop@gmail.com for the time being. More details will be available soon. \n\n<3 \n\nThank you for all your support! \n\n-- The OSCA Alumni Web Dev Team"
